Vocational education is education that prepares students for work in a specific trade, a craft, as a technician, or in professional vocations such as engineering, accountancy, nursing, medicine, architecture, or law. Craft vocations – such as jewellery making, or metalwork such as those training to become silversmiths – are usually based on manual or practical activities and are traditionally non-academic, but related to a specific trade or occupation. Vocational education is sometimes referred to as career education or technical education. So from the explanation above, the relation between vocational education and link & match programs is like mother and son.',
